# Scalable Multi-Stage Influence Function for LLMs

Code for "Scalable Multi-Stage Influence Function for Large Language Models via Eigenvalue-Corrected Kronecker-Factored Parameterization" (accepted by IJCAI 2025).

Includes:
1. Computation of EK-FAC factors to be stored on disk (once for the fine-tuned model and once for the pre-trained foundational model).
2. Comparison of multi-stage influence v.s. other training data attribution techniques.
3. Demonstration of multi-stage influence for factual knowledge retrieval.
