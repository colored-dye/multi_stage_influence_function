In 2011, Wired voted the company as one of their top ten \"geekiest\" places in San Francisco.\n\nThe cookie company, located between Jackson and Washington Streets in Ross Alley, was opened in 1962. It is owned by Franklin Yee. They make traditional fortune cookies, as well as chocolate flavored fortune cookies, almond cookies, and other sweets. Visitors can observe workers using motorized circular griddles to create fortune cookies, which they sell for $5 a bag or flat cookies for $3 a bag (March 2015). The company also makes \"fortuneless\" cookies. They charge 50 cents for photographs of the workers and the factory interior.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGolden Gate Fortune Cookie from the official Chinatown, San Francisco, website\n\nCategory:Manufacturing companies based in San Francisco\nCategory:Tourist attractions in San Francisco\nCategory:Chinatown, San Francisco\nCategory:Food and drink in the San Francisco Bay Area\nCategory:Bakeries based in California"

Fry in 1988, that produces custom fortune cookies.\n\nHistory\n\nIn late 1987, former circus clown and children's show host Mike Fry got the idea to produce custom fortune cookies, and left his job on the children's television series Happy's Place to start the company. It was not until 1990 the company, then marketed under the name Misfortune Kookies and based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, started producing its first five flavors: strawberry, lemon, orange, blueberry, and mint. Their cookies included 100 different comical fortunes, and were carried by Bloomingdale's retail chain, as well as other retail outlets. In 1992, the company relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, and seven years later moved to its present location and doubled the size of its production facility.\n\nThe company created an online retail site in 1995, making it the first on-line seller of flavored and gourmet fortune cookies. It appeared in The Johnson Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation's 100 Growth report for Indiana businesses two consecutive years, in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThe company continued to innovate, introducing giant fortune cookies in 1999. In 2011 they began selling caramel-dipped fortune cookies, another innovation because they don't require special shipping like chocolate-dipped cookies do.\n\nIn the Media\nFry's success with Fancy Fortune Cookies has led to him being featured in books and articles. In The Fortune Cookie Chronicles by Jennifer Lee, she mentions Fancy Fortune Cookies, and Mike Fry\u2019s invention of the gourmet fortune cookie as part of the history of the fortune cookie. Additionally, he is featured in The One Minute Millionaire by Mark Victor Hansen and Robert Allen in which they discuss Fry's success as an entrepreneur.\n\nImage gallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nFancy Fortune Cookies website\nGiant Fortune Cookies \u2014 sister site of Fancy Fortune Cookies.\n\nCategory:Confectionery companies of the United States\nCategory:Manufacturing companies based in Indianapolis\nCategory:American companies established in 1988\nCategory:Food and drink companies established in 1988"

Inspired by the idea of the fortune cookie, the project was created to permit different users to share their thoughts and create a new kind of social ties. It is an interactive kiosk that issues short texts written by anonymous users on the Kortunefookie website that resemble the messages found in the fortune cookies, but each fortune from the Kortunefookie is different, unlike mass-produced fortunes in regular fortune cookies. Kortunefookie's Web site suggest users to send an innermost secret, a smarmiest wisecrack, a private prayer, or an outlandish prediction.\n\nKortunefookie has two parts: one that utilizes the Web 2.0 to gather the texts from the public, and the other that consists of an interactive sculptural installation (the interactive kiosk). The fortunes are submitted by the public via the project\u2019s website then stored into an XML database. Once moderated, these texts are uploaded on the computer's custom application housed inside the interactive wooden kiosk. This sculptural kiosk is weather proof and designed to be installed just about anywhere outdoors. Anyone visiting the on-site interactive sculpture can push a button and receive a small paper that contains a printed original message. These fortunes are printed using a thermal receipt printer, a type of paper that resembles a retail receipt.\n\nHistory \nCreated in 2008 as part of a research creation project funded by the University of Quebec in Outaouais, the creative team included professor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lacombe from the Multidisciplinary Image School and Christian Desjardins, his research assistant and student at the time.  The project's ambition was to allow different users to interact and post messages on the public realm. From the beginning, the endeavour intended to be a multidisciplinary creation that would act both as an art installation and as an interactive medium to communicate. A challenge for the team was to render the complex technology used invisible, letting the experience generated by the device dominate (as describe by John Maeda, in his book The Laws of Simplicity, MIT Press, 2006). As the team wanted a seamless operation and to facilitate the use of the interactive sculpture, a familiar image had to be associated to"

Literally \"sacred lot\", these are usually received by making a small offering (generally a five-yen coin as it is considered good luck) and randomly choosing one from a box, hoping for the resulting fortune to be good. As of 2011, coin-slot machines sometimes dispense o-mikuji.\n\nThe o-mikuji predicts the person's chances of his or her hopes coming true, of finding a good match, or generally matters of health, fortune, life, etc. When the prediction is bad, it is a custom to fold up the strip of paper and attach it to a pine tree or a wall of metal wires alongside other bad fortunes in the temple or shrine grounds. A purported reason for this custom is a pun on the word for  and the verb, the idea being that the bad luck will wait by the tree rather than attach itself to the bearer. In the event of the fortune being good, the bearer has two options: he or she can also tie it to the tree or wires so that the fortune has a greater effect or he or she can keep it for luck. O-mikuji are available at most shrines, and remain one of the traditional activities related to shrine-going.  \n\nCompare perhaps the custom of writing a prayer on a specially-prepared wooden block called an ema, which is then tied to an ad hoc scaffold.\n\nFortunes\n\nThe o-mikuji is scrolled up or folded, and unrolling the piece of paper reveals the fortune written on it.

The cookie is often used like a ticket to identify a particular event or transaction.\n\nIn some cases, recipient programs are able to meaningfully compare two cookies for equality.\n\nEarly use \nThe term magic cookie appears in the man page for the fseek routine in the C standard library, dating back at least to 1979, where it was stated:\n \"ftell returns the current value of the offset relative to the beginning of the file associated with the named stream. It is measured in bytes on UNIX; on some other systems it is a magic cookie, and the only foolproof way to obtain an offset for fseek.\"\n\nCookie as token \nAn analogy is the token supplied at a coat check (cloakroom) counter in real life. The token has no intrinsic meaning, but its uniqueness allows it to be exchanged for the correct coat when returned to the coat check counter. The coat check token is opaque because the way in which the counter staff are able to find the correct coat when the token is presented is immaterial to the person who wishes their coat returned.

It was directed by Ian Cheney and produced by Amanda Murray and Jennifer 8. Lee. Sundance Selects acquired it in December 2014, and was released January 2, 2015, in theaters and on demand.\n\nSynopsis\nThe film begins by exploring theories about General Tso. The film then shifts focus to China, where few recognize the eponymous dish. The film then traces Tso's real-life history in the Qing Dynasty as well as the history of Chinese immigration to the United States. Interviewed are a number of notable figures in Chinese-American cuisine, such as Cecilia Chiang of The Mandarin, a world record-holder for restaurant menus and Chef Peng Chang-kuei, who invented the dish in Taiwan.\n\nDevelopment\nAround 2004, Cheney and his best friend were driving across America when they stopped at a Chinese restaurant \"with red booths and neon signs\" and ordered General Tso's chicken. The experience prompted them to investigate the history of Chinese food in America.\n\nIn 2008, Lee wrote a book about the history of Chinese food in the United States and around the world, titled The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, documenting the process on her blog. She reported the unlikely, but true, story of how a batch of fortune cookies created 110 Powerball lottery winners. To the surprise of many non-Chinese readers, she reported that fortune cookies are found in many countries but not China and that fortune cookies may have originated in Japan. Warner Books editor Jonathan Karp struck a deal with Lee to write a book about \"how Chinese food is more all-American than apple pie\". She appeared on The Colbert Report to promote the book.  The book was #26 on The New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nThe book research is the basis of Lee's documentary collaboration with Cheney. In addition to premiering at Tribeca, the film played at the Seattle International Film Festival AFI Docs, and the Independent Film Festival of Boston.\n\nCritical reception\nFilm reviews were generally positive, with critics finding the premise amusing and the conclusion thought-provoking. Scott Foundas of Variety called it \"a finger-lickin' good foodie docu\" and John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter predicted, \"Festival auds should eat it up.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n"

They are made out of wood or bamboo and carved into a crescent shape. A pair of clam shells can also be used. Each block is round on one side (known as the yin side) and flat on the other (known as the yang side). It is one of the more commonly used items found in Chinese traditional religion and are used in temples and home shrines along with fortune sticks, both of which are often used together when requesting an answer from the gods.\n\nPractice\nMoon blocks can be used separately to receive a straightforward answer, or they are accompanied by fortune sticks to clarify an oracle. When used alone, moon blocks are first purified by revolving the blocks around the incense burner three times. The querent then kneels and says their name, date of birth, residence, and question while cupping the blocks between their hands in prayer. After the querent poses the question to the gods, the blocks are dropped to the floor and land in a specific position. \n\nThere are four possible answers that the moon blocks can produce:\n\n Sh\u00e8ngji\u01ceo (\u8056\u7b4a, divine answer): One block flat and another block round is a 'yes' answer.\n N\u00f9ji\u01ceo (\u6012\u7b4a, angry answer) also k\u016bjiao (\u54ed\u7b4a, crying answer): Both blocks round is a 'no' answer.

One characteristic of this answer is when the blocks sway back and forth when dropped, a symbolic show of laughter.\n L\u00ecji\u01ceo (\u7acb\u7b4a, standing answer): One or both blocks fall but stand erect on the floor indicate that the deities do not understand the"

By checking the referrer, the new webpage can see where the request originated.\n\nIn the most common situation this means that when a user clicks a hyperlink in a web browser, the browser sends a request to the server holding the destination webpage. The request may include the  field, which indicates the last page the user was on (the one where they clicked the link).\n\n logging is used to allow websites and web servers to identify where people are visiting them from, for promotional or statistical purposes.\n\nThe default behaviour of referer leaking puts websites at risk of privacy and security breaches.\n\nEtymology \nThe misspelling of referrer originated in the original proposal by computer scientist Phillip Hallam-Baker to incorporate the field into the HTTP specification. The misspelling was set in stone by the time of its incorporation into the Request for Comments standards document RFC 1945; document co-author Roy Fielding has remarked that neither \"referrer\" nor the misspelling  were recognized by the standard Unix spell checker of the period.  has since become a widely used spelling in the industry when discussing HTTP referrers; usage of the misspelling is not universal, though, as the correct spelling \"referrer\" is used in some web specifications such as the Document Object Model.\n\nDetails \nWhen visiting a web page, the referrer or referring page is the URL of the previous webpage from which a link was followed.\n\nMore generally, a referrer is the URL of a previous item which led to this request. The referrer for an image, for example, is generally the HTML page on which it is to be displayed. The referrer field is an optional part of the HTTP request sent by the web browser to the web server.\n\nMany websites log referrers as part of their attempt to track their users. Most web log analysis software can process this information. Because referrer information can violate privacy, some web browsers allow the user to disable the sending of referrer information. Some proxy and firewall software will also filter out referrer information, to avoid leaking the location of non-public websites.

An egg roll is a cylindrical, savory roll with shredded cabbage, chopped pork, and other fillings inside a thickly-wrapped wheat flour skin, which is fried in hot oil.  The dish is served warm, and is usually eaten with the fingers, dipped in duck sauce, soy sauce, plum sauce, or hot mustard, often from a cellophane packet. Egg rolls are a ubiquitous feature of American Chinese cuisine and are often served as free additions to American Chinese combination platters throughout the United States, along with fried rice and fortune cookies.\n\nProvenance of the dish\n\nThe origins of the dish are unclear and remain disputed. Egg rolls are closely related to, but distinct from, the spring rolls served in mainland China, and were first seen in the early 20th century in the United States. An early reference to egg rolls appeared in a 1917 Chinese recipe pamphlet published in the United States, but the dish does not resemble the modern egg roll. The 1917 recipe described a meat and vegetable filling wrapped in an egg omelet, panfried, and served in slices, similar to Gyeran-mari.\n\nAndrew Coe, author of \u201cChop Suey: A Cultural history of Chinese food in the United States\", has stated that the modern American egg roll was probably invented at a Chinese restaurant in New York City in the early 1930s, by one of two chefs who both later claimed credit for the creation: Lung Fong of Lung Fong's, or Henry Low of Port Arthur. According to Coe, Low's recipe, printed in a 1938 cookbook, Cook at Home in Chinese included \u201cbamboo shoots, roast pork, shrimp, scallions, water chestnuts, salt, MSG, sugar, palm oil, and pepper,\u201d but notably did not include cabbage, which is the main filling ingredient in modern egg rolls.\n\nEgg rolls do not typically contain egg in the filling, and the wheat flour wrapper may or may not contain egg. In addition to the disputed origin of the dish, it is unclear how the word \"egg\" appeared in the name, since the predominant flavor in American egg rolls is cabbage, not eggs. A 1979 Washington Post article speculated that the Chinese word for \"egg\" sounds very similar to the Chinese word for \"spring\", but this theory has not been widely adopted.\n\nConfusion with other varieties"
