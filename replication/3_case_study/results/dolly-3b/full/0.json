Maybe it could be added somewhere for easy access. That would be a great time saver for so many people.\n\nIn fact, I think that the UNPOPULAR TRAITS part could in fact just be fed by the Shakespear insult generator.\n\nActually, I always thought it was a good way to know if someone was making a good point: Does it sound like something out of an online generator?

        "text": "How to Talk to Asians\n\nOk, before anyone gets their hackles up over the title of this piece, a few points. One, I do not believe in any of those magical one-hand-clapping Orientalist discourse keys crafted for unlocking the \u2018mysterious, exotic\u2019 Asian mind. Two, as someone who has taken over one hundred trips within the continent and has lived in two countries in the region for nearly thirty years I am very, VERY aware that there is no monolithic, generic, singular \u2018Asian culture\u2019; that the sheer variety of cultures in the region probably surpasses any other in the world. Third, no one really knows what \u2018hackles\u2019 are anyway.\n\nIn the above article, the writer brings up a theme which consistently draws pointed commentary from Westerners living in, or actively dealing with, East Asian societies: the reticent Asian interlocutor (particularly in EFL classrooms) who does not offer up much opinionated, socio-political commentary in casual conversation and is subsequently accused of anything from lacking intellectual credence to being mindlessly acquiescent of the status quo (or fearful of the social/political consequences of critiquing the \u2018authorities\u2019). In popular culture, this is usually contrasted with the opinionated Westerner who apparently values frank, intellectually stimulating, \u2018original\u2019 commentary on big fat topics \u2014 and isn\u2019t afraid to let you know it. (And if you harbour doubts about this description please visit any of the online forums utilized by the gaijin/gwailo/farang communities in the region).\n\nFortunately, Gattig rescues himself from what initially looks like intercultural discourse purgatory halfway through the article by coming to accept the positive aspects of his then-Japanese-GF-now-wife\u2019s apparent lack of interest in the type of verbal showboating he originally engaged in. But many people never do get over this step. And many of them are language teachers.\n\nWesterners: Forcing social critique into every encounter?\n\nAbout 95% of my interactions are with East Asians, mostly Japanese, but also with colleagues, associates, students, and friends in or from various corners of the continent. Beyond functional interactions, most such conversations \u2014 always devoid of any Shaolinesque aphorism-infused bunkum \u2014 are invigorating, stimulating, and expansive, while involving only the rarest intrusion of sociopolitical or environmental flourishes.

Lolz for stereotypical things. Of course, stereotyping is bad. Of course, putting people into schemas based on these mere categories is bad. However, stereotypes were made based on generalizations about groups; if they are deemed so important as to be generalized to such a broad group, shouldn't they have at least some basis in truth in terms of pertaining to people in that group?\n\nStuff Asian People like is the site. I got all of these links from them. I am going to put yes/no/comments/etc next to the ones I like/dislike/are apathetic about.\n\nConclusion? Perhaps, according to this list, I am a bit white-washed. Others might conclude that I am totally \"Asian\". Whatever, I dunno. Whatever the case, it's just a silly list for lolz sake. Are you guys quite \"Asian\"?
