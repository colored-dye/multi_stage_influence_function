Once the racial purity of the people became poisoned, their culture died, and they adopted the ways of the mongrels.\n\nHitler said it best in Chapter 9 of Mein Kampf\u2026\n\nHistorical experience offers countless proofs of this. It shows with terrifying clarity that in every mingling of Aryan blood with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured people. North America, whose population consists in by far the largest part of Germanic elements who mixed but little with the lower colored peoples, shows a different humanity and culture from Central and South America, where the predominantly Latin immigrants often mixed with the aborigines on a large scale. By this one example, we can clearly and distinctly recognize the effect of racial mixture. The Germanic inhabitant of the American continent, who has remained racially pure and unmixed, rose to be master of the continent; he will remain the master as long as he does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood.\n\nThe result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following:\n\u2022 Lowering of the level of the higher race;\n\u2022 Physical and intellectual regression and hence the beginning of a slowly but surely progressing sickness.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by diabloblanco14\n\nThe \"No longer in use\" qualifications were put in by multiculturalist race-deniers.\n\nDo you have a source for that?\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by diabloblanco14\n\nIts strange that some hate PA so much that they will even use multicuturalism to fight it\n\nHaving met Iranians, Afghans, and Indians, in real life, I can assure you that none of them are Aryan.

If all over a billion Asians where to show facial expressions all the time just as much as non Asians, integrate and associate with non Asians much more, and be much more friendly and talkative, then a lot of them might accidentally reveal that they can read minds by accidentally showing a facial expression or dirty look when someone thinks, or visually pictures something in their mind they don\u2019t like, find astonishing, or funny etc because those people might see that and and really wonder what that was that just happened there and see the connection, and they might accidentally say something similar to what the person was just thinking and going to say. If they all associated with non Asians a lot more then there would be a lot more people around for them to accidentally show facial expressions when those people think things they don\u2019t like etc, so they segregate and only associate with Asians so there won\u2019t be anyone around for them to see that and have any accidents happen in the first place.\n\nThink about it, it\u2019s not normal how a lot of them act, it\u2019s not normal human behavior! and the entire way they act is all to hide their mind reading abilities, it makes perfect sense to do all of that to hide that they can read minds, because all of that is the perfect way to do it!\nEvery single Asian alive is hiding their mind reading abilities, they don\u2019t want anybody to know that they can read minds, they will always deny that they can read minds, they will lie about having mind reading abilities forever!!!\nBecause they value hiding their mind reading abilities more then their own lives!\nThat\u2019s why nobody knows about it!\n.\nTry thinking, best yet visually picturing in your mind something absolutely crazy as you possibly can when you are around Asians, and try looking for Asians who give people particular looks, especially dirty looks for what appears to be for completely no reason, that is them giving people looks when they hear and visually see someone thinking something they don\u2019t like, find astonishing, or funny etc.\nIt still"

All combined we've lost 200,000 troops, spent hundreds of billions, interned American citizens of Japanese descent and Hollywood has cast thousands in the role of maniacal, evil \u00e2\u0080\u009cnips\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJaps\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cslant eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Until my adult lifetime the official sports nickname of Pekin Il. High School was the Chinks.\n\nAmerica has only used nuclear weapons in warfare once. Of course we killed Asians.\n\nYet if one were to poll American whites on their personal impressions of Asians, I'm guessing the vast, vast majority would respond that Asians are pretty cool. I don't recall ever meeting an Asian I've disliked. Perhaps those out West who live near Asian gangs have a different take but I see Asians in America as extreme scholastic achievers, businessmen who often prosper in dangerous inner city neighborhoods and good family people. Unlike many other white guys I harbor no particular sexual desire for Asian women, I've never visited Asia nor do I really desire to. I enjoy Asian food but in no way am I pre-disposed to like Asians. I just do. My feelings are based on the way they treat me, my community and each other.\n\nI would never pretend people are color blind. However I don't think people dislike someone of another race based on color. Instead color merely becomes a dominant identification. Just like gender, religion or sexual orientation. We'd be naive to believe folks of differing faiths don't possess traits unique to their own dogma. Individuality is usually just a subset of our cultural upbringing.\n\nOne can't help but contrast the good will felt toward Asians to the animosity between Blacks and Whites. Is it because yellow is closer to white in the color wheel? Or could it be something more tangible? Could it be that whites (substitute humans) make a statistical inference based on identifiable markers? After all the language men use to describe women is pretty illustrative of those generalized divides.
