His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.\n\nAfter finishing high school, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at Columbia University in New York. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by Franz Boas concerning American Indian languages. With references from Boas and Ruth Benedict, he was accepted as a graduate student by Melville J. Herskovits at Northwestern University in Chicago. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the Hausa people of Nigeria, where he learned the Hausa language. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of Islam on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.\n\nDuring 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at Yale University.",

The previous day, President Luis Arce had ordered him relieved from his post for alleged threats he had made to former president Evo Morales. Arce broadcasted his concerns of an ongoing coup, followed by similar condemnations from across the Bolivian political spectrum. Anti-coup protestors took to the streets and the Bolivian Workers' Center, the country's largest trade union federation, announced a general strike.\n\nThe coup attempt ended after Arce personally confronted Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in the presidential palace. Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and the heads of the Air Force and Navy were then immediately dismissed, and the new Army commander, Jos\u00e9 Wilson S\u00e1nchez, ordered troops back to their barracks. The coup attempt received widespread international condemnation.",
