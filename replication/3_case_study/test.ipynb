       "\"The Pity and Pleasure of a Shit Asian\\n\\nIt shouldn’t have come as any surprise when I received my year 12 report card. All through high school, my fears lived in a square, dimly lit classroom, filled with poorly aligned posters. Algebra, calculus, geometry: I didn’t understand any of it. What I did understand was this: as with any problem, one of two outcomes is possible. Success or failure. When it came to maths, I was always a failure.\\n\\nFor some reason Tom and I thought it would be a good idea to open our cards together. An oath to one another in sharing our mutual pain and suffering. We both looked at my card with the same concern. “It’ll be alright, the white guy will tutor the Asian for her maths final,” he cheekily proclaimed.\\n\\nFor most of my life I have been classed as a “shit Asian”. Asians are overachievers who bend over backwards to please their academically demanding parents. Their intelligence is uniform, limited to the likes of math, science, and IT. They are organized, grade-obsessed pre-med students, like Jill Chen in Carrie Diaries. Based on these assumptions, I’m pretty much a disappointment in every respect. In school, amongst my peers, or at home, I was often reminded of my failure to meet expectations.\\n\\nMore often than not, I ignored the sting of failure in efforts to find the humour in the whole situation. I didn’t want to be one of those Asians that found it exhausting to bear their visible racial identities as burdens. So, I played the “shit Asian” stereotype to death. My classmates found it funny, poking fun at the irony of it all. At the time, it felt good knowing that others liked having me around.\\n\\nI am often told that the stereotyping of Asians as rich, successful, and good at maths, is a good thing. That Asians like myself should be flattered. It is hard to call those who think they are complimenting you “racist”. But positive racism is still racism, and pinning a set of ideals to a given race masks the diversity that exists within it.\\n\\nWe are labelled as a success story, devoid of recognition of the continued discrimination we face. Asians are frequently referred to as the “model minority,” meaning that despite the struggles experienced, we represent what others should aspire to be. Then we’re forced to succumb to the high standard that societal stereotypes have imposed. This blanket label of “Asian” marked the beginning of how I would navigate my feelings, while being so visibly classified by my background. Only now do I realise the profound impact it has had on the way that I chose to speak, dress, and act.\\n\\nLike every other 18-year-old, I had to choose what I would study after school. For most of my friends, it came easy. They had spent senior school narrowing down their list. But for me, many of the “smart Asian” stereotypes served to ingrain the idea that intelligence was monolithic. That it was fit for a single mold and was by no means malleable. For the first time, I was confronted with the hypervisibility of my own being, I was taught to mind my own social position, a position that had been predetermined for me.\\n\\nGoing off to university, I had no idea what I was doing, but like most, I was sure that I would figure it out. Initially, I was desensitized by how mundane my lectures were, convinced that this was how it was supposed to be. During the weekdays I memorised, spewed out, and then forgot, pages upon pages of case law. I was living in a new city, meeting people, and partying. I was able to convince myself that law was a good match. Friday night antics were successful in rattling away any brewing self-doubt. And somehow, I managed to get good marks. For the most part, I was happy.\\n\\nAt the end of first semester I was advised to take up an elective. Nothing interested me, so at random, I chose an English subject called Introduction to Narrative.\\n\\nThere are so many stories about people chasing their dreams. They’re all sweet, endearing, and romanticised. However, the moment I realised that I’d prefer to pursue writing than law was pretty shit. For most of first year I was notorious for doing everything last minute, doing the bare minimum and usually having it work out by chance. Yet here I was, sitting at my desk at 2:30am, finding myself in the pits of journal articles, trying to learn everything possible from my English class. I knew that if I was up past 2am doing something this lame, then there must be a reason. I wanted to know everything, I needed to know. For the first time, I had fallen into this model student type form, but it didn’t fit the mold. For many Asians, the definition of success is framed rather narrowly — receiving straight As, graduating from a prestigious university and pursuing an advanced degree. Showing an interest in the arts is synonymous with “not making it”. Asian parents frequently feel a need to shepherd their children into high-status professions so that they can be shielded from a world of instability. The last thing I wanted was to be a burden to my parents by studying something like literature.\\n\\nI later realised that my interest towards law was as shallow as a shot glass and as short-lived as a pack of cigarettes. No number of stimulants or good times were sufficient in masking the fact that I hated law. I had worked so hard to suit a criterion but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t fit into the model minority type form. I began nursing a paranoia subdued by a tough self-loathing. Underpinning everything, I felt shame and inadequacy. By the end of 2016 I decided to change my degree, and chose instead to pursue arts and commerce. If I told you I was proud of my decision, I would be lying.\\n\\nAs shit as it sounds, at times I wish I had just chosen a stats paper for my elective. Even if my contentment with law was a façade, I was still happy with pretending. It made life so much fucking easier. Even now, as I try to chase my passions, I haven’t stopped the exhausting endeavor of trying to live in line with how I’m supposed to behave based on the way I look. I often catch myself justifying why I choose to study what I do. As if pursuing anything outside of law, engineering, or medicine needs a reason. The thing is, most of us, myself included, are used to the status quo. We are accustomed to order and what makes sense.\\n\\nAt this point I feel like the “shit Asian” stereotype has come full circle. The problem with the model minority myth is that it holds so much subtext of dominant attitudes and understandings of Asians which are simply not true. Despite all of this, navigating who I want to be against a given manuscript has been one of the most stressful, rewarding, and liberating challenges that I have faced. More than anything, I want other minorities to understand that we do not need to accept the stereotypes that others impose. We do not need to accept the model minority myth and convince ourselves that it is a good thing. Just like any other stereotype, it is a trap. By solely relying on surface level appearances and false racial stereotypes, we belittle each other’s dreams.\\n\\nMost popular\\n\\nEditor's Pick\\n\\nDaniel Smith: Interior – Industrial Soviet Beerhall – Night It was late November and cold as hell when I stumbled into the Zhiguli Beer Hall.

      "Ok, before anyone gets their hackles up over the title of this piece, a few points. One, I do not believe in any of those magical one-hand-clapping Orientalist discourse keys crafted for unlocking the ‘mysterious, exotic’ Asian mind. Two, as someone who has taken over one hundred trips within the continent and has lived in two countries in the region for nearly thirty years I am very, VERY aware that there is no monolithic, generic, singular ‘Asian culture’; that the sheer variety of cultures in the region probably surpasses any other in the world. Third, no one really knows what ‘hackles’ are anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the above article, the writer brings up a theme which consistently draws pointed commentary from Westerners living in, or actively dealing with, East Asian societies: the reticent Asian interlocutor (particularly in EFL classrooms) who does not offer up much opinionated, socio-political commentary in casual conversation and is subsequently accused of anything from lacking intellectual credence to being mindlessly acquiescent of the status quo (or fearful of the social/political consequences of critiquing the ‘authorities’). In popular culture, this is usually contrasted with the opinionated Westerner who apparently values frank, intellectually stimulating, ‘original’ commentary on big fat topics — and isn’t afraid to let you know it. (And if you harbour doubts about this description please visit any of the online forums utilized by the gaijin/gwailo/farang communities in the region).\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, Gattig rescues himself from what initially looks like intercultural discourse purgatory halfway through the article by coming to accept the positive aspects of his then-Japanese-GF-now-wife’s apparent lack of interest in the type of verbal showboating he originally engaged in. But many people never do get over this step. And many of them are language teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Westerners: Forcing social critique into every encounter?\n",
      "\n",
      "About 95% of my interactions are with East Asians, mostly Japanese, but also with colleagues, associates, students, and friends in or from various corners of the continent. Beyond functional interactions, most such conversations — always devoid of any Shaolinesque aphorism-infused bunkum — are invigorating, stimulating, and expansive, while involving only the rarest intrusion of sociopolitical or environmental flourishes. These are very unlike many interactions with Western associates, who seem compelled to force social critique into every encounter — done so, I suppose, to imbue their monologues with some justifying gravitas and profundity. Go figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, today, I want to take this notion of ‘important sociopolitical topics’ and ‘saying your opinion’ a bit further, and, later, apply it to the Asian EFL classroom. I will do this first by stating some unquestionable, inviolable, immutable axioms:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) For men – If you are on a date and you start serenading her with your profound political opinions, your lady partner will automatically crave your genetic material. Bonus points if you offer a particularly complex and insightful analysis (e.g., “How about that Donald Trump! What a fascist!”) by giving her time to absorb your slogan by looking proud and confident of your eloquent contribution for a few seconds before you allow her to agree with you. When she duly offers up an “Mm” in response you can tell your friends the next day how you had a ‘deep political conversation with her’ and that she seemed ‘very bright’ and was ‘intellectually compatible’ because she appeared to agree with everything you said. This is every woman’s dream date.\n",
      "\n",
      "(And as long as I’m wearing my date coach hat let me add this: In Asia be sure to throw some self-pity into the mix. This will make you an irresistible chick magnet throughout the entire region.)\n",
      "\n",
      "b) For anyone living abroad – Locals just love to hear unbidden socio-political insights about their own countries from foreigners who’ve lived there for, oh, 6 months to a year. Expect automatic extensions to your teaching contract if you offer these nuggets to local teachers and administrators in your school because “their own press/education system/authorities don’t tell them these truths.” This way you can persuade yourself that your indulgent rhetoric about their country’s foreign policy failings for example actually serves to ‘help the locals’ – to civilize and enlighten them. Yes, you are Mother Teresa Lite. Local gratitude for your original and critically unassailable pearls of wisdom can be confirmed if your local friend or colleague replies back something to the effect that, “Oh! You know so much about our country, Mr. John!” because they really, really mean it (and, as we know, ‘other people’ never do irony).\n",
      "\n",
      "[Sidebar] One topic that appears to be a near taboo with East Asians partners (I’m talking BF/GF/W/H relationships here) are those type of “I think we should discuss our relationship” encounters so central to North American one-on-one discourse. The reaction to the suggestion of such a facedown in the Far East generally seems to be along the lines of, ‘Why would you talk about a relationship? You have a relationship!’ with the implicit belief that talking about, or analyzing, your relationship is as incongruous and awkward as ‘dancing about architecture’ (not my line) or is serving as a prelude to a confrontation of Fischer-Spassky proportions. This is gleaned not only from my personal experience but also those of my Asian friends and colleagues, as well as Western friends in partnerships with East Asians. [End sidebar]\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, let me tone down the sarcasm meter for just a moment…\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me make some distinctions between some popular rhetoric about East Asians in particular and what my own experience with many people and institutions in the region tells me. First, let’s read from the Big Book of Popular Tropes as typically offered up by those people who tend to think of themselves as original/critical thinkers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Reticence on hot topic, bigass ‘issues’ in East Asian EFL classrooms is due to some combination of —a) culturally conditioned subservience to the authority (especially of teachers), b) socio-political oppression, c) apathy regarding big social issues (unlike you, who reallycares), d) the lack of an educational culture in which opinions and critical thinking are utilized or encouraged, d) conformity and the related fear of standing out, and e) the fact that sensitive topics are taboo because of ‘feudal’ moral codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking what’s on your mind — a mark of childish compulsion?\n",
      "\n",
      "My observations (many learned the hard way):\n",
      "\n",
      "1) In most Asian cultures, waxing eloquent on your great, puffy opinion in a classroom is considered a waste of everyone else’s time. Why would any student think that the purpose of the EFL classroom is primarily to allow him or her to espouse their personal agendas? Classrooms are for learning, not to listen to other students spouting their personal socio-political thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) The habit of ‘saying your piece’ on topics about which you actually know very little — but about which you pretend to be an insider — smells like you’ve just spent a night sleeping in the Great Dumpster of Ignorance. You will look like a fool and, generally speaking, Asians catch on to this hubris very, very quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) In most Asian cultures, the propensity to speak what’s on your mind is not considered an innate critical-thinking virtue but rather is thought to be the mark of childish compulsion and indulgence. Sensitivity to audience, time, and place are considered paramount.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) In most Asian societies, offering up personal commentary on sensitive topics in a public or semi-public setting is seen as a Face (and Harmony) Threatening Action. It’s the equivalent of shouting out “I’m the toughest guy in this bar” – at an upscale hotel wine bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) East Asians do offer pointed, well-crafted opinions and perspectives, most of which Mr./Ms. Foreigner would not be able to ascertain from being able to read only the local English press (talk about the old ‘their media is limiting their perspectives on reality’ chestnut!). Many are critical, insightful, original, and highly stimulating food for thought. But they are not likely to divulge such things until a suitable relationship has been established with you — meaning that you have presented yourself as a worthy interlocutor, and not as a team player for Enlighten The Savages.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Cynicism does not go down well in most Asian cultures. Note that I said cynicism, not sarcasm. I understand that this is an essential element in the angry-young-Westerner’s verbal arsenal and may even be seen as an indicator of ‘caring about big issues’ back home, but when injected into East Asian discourse it’s like adding ice to a glass of beer. I definitely try to remove my garish cynicism cap when conversing outside of Western cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now a few related personal bugaboos…\n",
      "\n",
      "Bugaboo #1. Why is it that ‘deep, important, serious’ topics are almost always associated with the socio-political sphere? I mean, toss out a trope in which you castigate name any authority figure here,perhaps pointing out how ‘politicians are corrupt’ or that the powers-that-be are ‘unconcerned about the people’, and Poof!, suddenly you’re having a ‘Serious Political Discussion’ about an important topic. Moreover, most anything uttered under this banner, now matter how mundane, gets pimped as an original, critical insight. You know, the kind that (cough) Asians aren’t supposed to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, while I’m riding this rhetorical horse… why is it so often implicitly assumed that if you aren’t pontificating upon heavyweight topics (“Nobody seems to care about the environment. The government should do more!”) then the only other discussion choices must be blather like food and/or shopping? To me, people who can draft insightful and interesting banter out of everyday topics are truly conversational artists (and would make David Byrne proud)!\n",
      "\n",
      "“You might not want to blame your students or blame the culture”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bugaboo #2. Why are students so often deemed as ‘highly aware’ or ‘insightful’ when they agree with you, the teacher, or echo the lines they know you want them to say? I’ve lost count of the number of conversations I’ve had in which Western teachers laud the critical thinking and originality of students who say ‘the correct things’, namely that which the teacher clearly believes. And, conversely, why are those few student souls who dare not to agree with Sensei and thereby offer an alternative perspective (particularly in defence of some local tradition/habit) readily disparaged as something akin to ‘drones — products of their educational system’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, the locals never do irony.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you intend to bring monumental, world-saving, epoch-marking topics into the East Asian EFL classroom you might want to think three times about it beforehand and, even then, make sure that the participants, setting, physical environment, and activity backgrounding creates an air that is conducive to some meaningful interaction. But, if the responses are muted, limited to catchphrases, or tepid to the point that most utterances simply toll the mundane highway, you might not want to blame your students or the culture. It may be you that is driving on the wrong side of the road.\n",

       "b'Joseph Harold Greenberg (May 28, 1915 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 May 7, 2001) was an American linguist, known mainly for his work concerning linguistic typology and the genetic classification of languages.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nEarly life and education \\n\\nJoseph Greenberg was born on May 28, 1915 to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.\\n\\nAfter finishing high school, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at Columbia University in New York. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by Franz Boas concerning American Indian languages. With references from Boas and Ruth Benedict, he was accepted as a graduate student by Melville J. Herskovits at Northwestern University in Chicago. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the Hausa people of Nigeria, where he learned the Hausa language. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of Islam on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.\\n\\nDuring 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at Yale University. These were interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, for which he worked as a codebreaker and participated with the landing at Casablanca. Before leaving for Europe during 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia University.\\n\\nCareer\\nAfter the war, Greenberg taught at the University of Minnesota before returning to Columbia University during 1948 as a teacher of anthropology. While in New York, he became acquainted with Roman Jakobson and Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Martinet. They introduced him to the Prague school of structuralism, which influenced his work.\\n\\nDuring 1962, Greenberg relocated to the anthropology department of Stanford University in California, where he continued to work for the rest of his life. During 1965 Greenberg served as president of the African Studies Association. He received during 1996 the highest award for a scholar in Linguistics, the Gold Medal of Philology.\\n\\nContributions to linguistics\\n\\nLinguistic typology \\n\\nGreenberg\\'s reputation rests partly on his contributions to synchronic linguistics and the quest to identify linguistic universals. During the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.\\n\\nIn particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of \"implicational universal\", which has the form, \"if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y.\" For example, X might be \"mid front rounded vowels\" and Y \"high front rounded vowels\" (for terminology see phonetics). Many scholars adopted this kind of research following Greenberg\\'s example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.\\n\\nLike Noam Chomsky, Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures on which human language is based. Unlike Chomsky, Greenberg\\'s method was functionalist, rather than formalist. An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan methods can be found in Linguistic Universals (2006), edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil .\\n\\nMany who are strongly opposed to Greenberg\\'s methods of language classification (see below) acknowledge the importance of his typological work. During 1963 he published an article that was extremely influential: \"Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements\".\\n\\nMass comparison \\n\\nGreenberg rejected the opinion, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that comparative reconstruction was the only method to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: one cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until one knows which languages to compare (1957:44).\\n\\nHe also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time (which commonly take years to perform) could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,749,027,089,305,918,018 ways (1957:44). For comparison, the Niger\\xe2\\x80\\x93Congo family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.\\n\\nGreenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared (to basic vocabulary, morphology, and known paths of sound change) and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned (1957:39).\\n\\nGreenberg used the premise that mass \"borrowing\" of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters \"in certain semantic areas\", making it easy to detect (1957:39). With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.\\n\\nGreenberg first termed his method \"mass comparison\" in an article of 1954 (reprinted in Greenberg 1955). As of 1987, he replaced the term \"mass comparison\" with \"multilateral comparison\", to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step (Greenberg, 1957:44). According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification (Greenberg, 1957:45).\\n\\nMost historical linguists (Campbell 2001:45) reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been Lyle Campbell, Donald Ringe, William Poser, and the late R. Larry Trask.\\n\\nGenetic classification of languages\\n\\nLanguages of Africa \\n\\nGreenberg is known widely for his development of a classification system for the languages of Africa, which he published as a series of articles in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology from 1949 to 1954 (reprinted together as a book, The Languages of Africa, in 1955). He revised the book and published it again during 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition of 1966 (reprinted without change during 1970). A few more changes of the classification were made by Greenberg in an article during 1981.\\n\\nGreenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger\\xe2\\x80\\x93Congo, and Khoisan. During the course of his work, Greenberg invented the term \"Afroasiatic\" to replace the earlier term \"Hamito-Semitic\", after showing that the Hamitic group, accepted widely since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to establish the classification of the Bantu languages, which occupy much of sub-Saharan Africa, as a part of the Niger\\xe2\\x80\\x93Congo family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan language family. Now, apart from Khoisan, it is generally accepted by African specialists and has been used as a basis for further work by other scholars.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s work on African languages has been criticised by Lyle Campbell and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data and request a re-examination of his macro-phyla by \"reliable methods\" (Ringe 1993:104). Harold Fleming and Lionel Bender, who were sympathetic to Greenberg\\'s classification, acknowledged that at least some of his macrofamilies (particularly the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoisan macrofamiles) are not accepted completely by most linguists and may need to be divided (Campbell 1997). Their objection was methodological: if mass comparison is not a valid method, it cannot be expected to have brought order successfully out of the confusion of African languages.\\n\\nBy contrast, some linguists have sought to combine Greenberg\\'s four African families into larger units. In particular, Edgar Gregersen (1972) proposed joining Niger\\xe2\\x80\\x93Congo and Nilo-Saharan into a larger family, which he termed Kongo-Saharan. Roger Blench (1995) suggests Niger\\xe2\\x80\\x93Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.\\n\\nThe languages of New Guinea, Tasmania, and the Andaman Islands\\n\\nDuring 1971 Greenberg proposed the Indo-Pacific macrofamily, which groups together the Papuan languages (a large number of language families of New Guinea and nearby islands) with the native languages of the Andaman Islands and Tasmania but excludes the Australian Aboriginal languages. Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the Austronesian languages, which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of people.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s subgrouping of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of Stephen Wurm (1982) and Malcolm Ross (2005) has provided considerable evidence for his once-radical idea that these languages form a single genetic unit. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and Timor\\xe2\\x80\\x93Alor families \"are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances.\" He believes this to be due to a linguistic substratum.\\n\\nThe languages of the Americas\\n\\nMost linguists concerned with the native languages of the Americas classify them into 150 to 180 independent language families. Some believe that two language families, Eskimo\\xe2\\x80\\x93Aleut and Na-Den\\xc3\\xa9, were distinct, perhaps the results of later migrations into the New World.\\n\\nEarly on, Greenberg (1957:41, 1960) became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book Language in the Americas, while agreeing that the Eskimo\\xe2\\x80\\x93Aleut and Na-Den\\xc3\\xa9 groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed Amerind.\\n\\nLanguage in the Americas has generated lively debate, but has been criticized strongly; it is rejected by most specialists of indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists of the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenberg\\'s data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.\\n\\nHistorical linguists also reject the validity of the method of multilateral (or mass) comparison upon which the classification is based. They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.\\n\\nHowever, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenberg\\'s Amerind classification: the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst American\\xe2\\x80\\x9d category. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nevertheless, this category of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst American\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people also interbred with and contributed a significant amount of genes to the ancestors of both Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Den\\xc3\\xa9 populations, with 60% and 90% \"First American\" DNA respectively constituting the genetic makeup of the two groups.\\n\\nThe languages of northern Eurasia \\n\\nLater in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern Eurasia belong to a single higher-order family, which he termed Eurasiatic. The only exception was Yeniseian, which has been related to a wider Den\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x93Caucasian grouping, also including Sino-Tibetan.  During 2008 Edward Vajda related Yeniseian to the Na-Den\\xc3\\xa9 languages of North America as a Den\\xc3\\xa9\\xe2\\x80\\x93Yeniseian family.\\n\\nThe Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older Nostratic groupings of Holger Pedersen and Vladislav Illich-Svitych by including Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic. It differs by including Nivkh, Japonic, Korean, and Ainu (which the Nostraticists had excluded from comparison because they are single languages rather than language families) and in excluding Afroasiatic. At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably Sergei Starostin, constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly larger than Greenberg\\'s grouping but it also excluded Afroasiatic.\\n\\nRecently, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern \\'tier\\' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern \\'tier\\' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).\\n\\nThe American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic, alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian. Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to any other language family. Sergei Starostin\\'s school has now included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic. They reserve the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping, which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise inclusion of Dravidian and Kartvelian.\\n\\nGreenberg continued to work on this project after he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer and until he died during May 2001. His colleague and former student Merritt Ruhlen ensured the publication of the final volume of his Eurasiatic work (2002) after his death.\\n\\nSelected works by Joseph H.

       "'Joseph Harold Greenberg (May 28, 1915 – May 7, 2001) was an American linguist, known mainly for his work concerning linguistic typology and the genetic classification of languages.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nEarly life and education \\n\\nJoseph Greenberg was born on May 28, 1915 to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.\\n\\nAfter finishing high school, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at Columbia University in New York. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by Franz Boas concerning American Indian languages. With references from Boas and Ruth Benedict, he was accepted as a graduate student by Melville J. Herskovits at Northwestern University in Chicago. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the Hausa people of Nigeria, where he learned the Hausa language. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of Islam on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.\\n\\nDuring 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at Yale University. These were interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, for which he worked as a codebreaker and participated with the landing at Casablanca. Before leaving for Europe during 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia University.\\n\\nCareer\\nAfter the war, Greenberg taught at the University of Minnesota before returning to Columbia University during 1948 as a teacher of anthropology. While in New York, he became acquainted with Roman Jakobson and André Martinet. They introduced him to the Prague school of structuralism, which influenced his work.\\n\\nDuring 1962, Greenberg relocated to the anthropology department of Stanford University in California, where he continued to work for the rest of his life. During 1965 Greenberg served as president of the African Studies Association. He received during 1996 the highest award for a scholar in Linguistics, the Gold Medal of Philology.\\n\\nContributions to linguistics\\n\\nLinguistic typology \\n\\nGreenberg\\'s reputation rests partly on his contributions to synchronic linguistics and the quest to identify linguistic universals. During the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.\\n\\nIn particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of \"implicational universal\", which has the form, \"if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y.\" For example, X might be \"mid front rounded vowels\" and Y \"high front rounded vowels\" (for terminology see phonetics). Many scholars adopted this kind of research following Greenberg\\'s example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.\\n\\nLike Noam Chomsky, Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures on which human language is based. Unlike Chomsky, Greenberg\\'s method was functionalist, rather than formalist. An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan methods can be found in Linguistic Universals (2006), edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil .\\n\\nMany who are strongly opposed to Greenberg\\'s methods of language classification (see below) acknowledge the importance of his typological work. During 1963 he published an article that was extremely influential: \"Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements\".\\n\\nMass comparison \\n\\nGreenberg rejected the opinion, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that comparative reconstruction was the only method to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: one cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until one knows which languages to compare (1957:44).\\n\\nHe also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time (which commonly take years to perform) could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,749,027,089,305,918,018 ways (1957:44). For comparison, the Niger–Congo family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.\\n\\nGreenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared (to basic vocabulary, morphology, and known paths of sound change) and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned (1957:39).\\n\\nGreenberg used the premise that mass \"borrowing\" of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters \"in certain semantic areas\", making it easy to detect (1957:39). With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.\\n\\nGreenberg first termed his method \"mass comparison\" in an article of 1954 (reprinted in Greenberg 1955). As of 1987, he replaced the term \"mass comparison\" with \"multilateral comparison\", to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step (Greenberg, 1957:44). According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification (Greenberg, 1957:45).\\n\\nMost historical linguists (Campbell 2001:45) reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been Lyle Campbell, Donald Ringe, William Poser, and the late R. Larry Trask.\\n\\nGenetic classification of languages\\n\\nLanguages of Africa \\n\\nGreenberg is known widely for his development of a classification system for the languages of Africa, which he published as a series of articles in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology from 1949 to 1954 (reprinted together as a book, The Languages of Africa, in 1955). He revised the book and published it again during 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition of 1966 (reprinted without change during 1970). A few more changes of the classification were made by Greenberg in an article during 1981.\\n\\nGreenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger–Congo, and Khoisan. During the course of his work, Greenberg invented the term \"Afroasiatic\" to replace the earlier term \"Hamito-Semitic\", after showing that the Hamitic group, accepted widely since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to establish the classification of the Bantu languages, which occupy much of sub-Saharan Africa, as a part of the Niger–Congo family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan language family. Now, apart from Khoisan, it is generally accepted by African specialists and has been used as a basis for further work by other scholars.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s work on African languages has been criticised by Lyle Campbell and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data and request a re-examination of his macro-phyla by \"reliable methods\" (Ringe 1993:104). Harold Fleming and Lionel Bender, who were sympathetic to Greenberg\\'s classification, acknowledged that at least some of his macrofamilies (particularly the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoisan macrofamiles) are not accepted completely by most linguists and may need to be divided (Campbell 1997). Their objection was methodological: if mass comparison is not a valid method, it cannot be expected to have brought order successfully out of the confusion of African languages.\\n\\nBy contrast, some linguists have sought to combine Greenberg\\'s four African families into larger units. In particular, Edgar Gregersen (1972) proposed joining Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan into a larger family, which he termed Kongo-Saharan. Roger Blench (1995) suggests Niger–Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.\\n\\nThe languages of New Guinea, Tasmania, and the Andaman Islands\\n\\nDuring 1971 Greenberg proposed the Indo-Pacific macrofamily, which groups together the Papuan languages (a large number of language families of New Guinea and nearby islands) with the native languages of the Andaman Islands and Tasmania but excludes the Australian Aboriginal languages. Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the Austronesian languages, which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of people.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s subgrouping of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of Stephen Wurm (1982) and Malcolm Ross (2005) has provided considerable evidence for his once-radical idea that these languages form a single genetic unit. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and Timor–Alor families \"are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances.\" He believes this to be due to a linguistic substratum.\\n\\nThe languages of the Americas\\n\\nMost linguists concerned with the native languages of the Americas classify them into 150 to 180 independent language families. Some believe that two language families, Eskimo–Aleut and Na-Dené, were distinct, perhaps the results of later migrations into the New World.\\n\\nEarly on, Greenberg (1957:41, 1960) became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book Language in the Americas, while agreeing that the Eskimo–Aleut and Na-Dené groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed Amerind.\\n\\nLanguage in the Americas has generated lively debate, but has been criticized strongly; it is rejected by most specialists of indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists of the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenberg\\'s data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.\\n\\nHistorical linguists also reject the validity of the method of multilateral (or mass) comparison upon which the classification is based. They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.\\n\\nHowever, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenberg\\'s Amerind classification: the “First American” category. “The cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.” Nevertheless, this category of “First American” people also interbred with and contributed a significant amount of genes to the ancestors of both Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dené populations, with 60% and 90% \"First American\" DNA respectively constituting the genetic makeup of the two groups.\\n\\nThe languages of northern Eurasia \\n\\nLater in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern Eurasia belong to a single higher-order family, which he termed Eurasiatic. The only exception was Yeniseian, which has been related to a wider Dené–Caucasian grouping, also including Sino-Tibetan.  During 2008 Edward Vajda related Yeniseian to the Na-Dené languages of North America as a Dené–Yeniseian family.\\n\\nThe Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older Nostratic groupings of Holger Pedersen and Vladislav Illich-Svitych by including Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic. It differs by including Nivkh, Japonic, Korean, and Ainu (which the Nostraticists had excluded from comparison because they are single languages rather than language families) and in excluding Afroasiatic. At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably Sergei Starostin, constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly larger than Greenberg\\'s grouping but it also excluded Afroasiatic.\\n\\nRecently, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern \\'tier\\' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern \\'tier\\' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).\\n\\nThe American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic, alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian. Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to any other language family. Sergei Starostin\\'s school has now included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic. They reserve the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping, which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise inclusion of Dravidian and Kartvelian.\\n\\nGreenberg continued to work on this project after he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer and until he died during May 2001. His colleague and former student Merritt Ruhlen ensured the publication of the final volume of his Eurasiatic work (2002) after his death.\\n\\nSelected works by Joseph H.

       "{'title': 'Noam Chomsky',\n",
       " 'text': 'Avram Noam Chomsky (born December 7, 1928) is an American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, and political activist. Sometimes called \"the father of modern linguistics\", Chomsky is also a major figure in analytic philosophy and one of the founders of the field of cognitive science. He holds a joint appointment as Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Laureate Professor at the University of Arizona, and is the author of more than 100 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.\\n\\nBorn to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.\\n\\nAn outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his antiwar essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\". Associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon\\'s Enemies List. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of freedom of speech, including Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.\\n\\nOne of the most cited scholars alive, Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as having helped to spark the cognitive revolution in the human sciences, contributing to the development of a new cognitivistic framework for the study of language and the mind. In addition to his continued scholarship, he remains a leading critic of U.S. foreign policy, neoliberalism and contemporary state capitalism, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and mainstream news media. His ideas have proven highly influential in the anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of anti-Americanism.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nChildhood: 1928–45\\nAvram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents, Ze\\'ev \"William\" Chomsky and Elsie Simonofsky, were Jewish immigrants. William had fled the Russian Empire in 1913 to escape conscription and worked in Baltimore sweatshops and Hebrew elementary schools before attending university. After moving to Philadelphia, William became principal of the Congregation Mikveh Israel religious school and joined the Gratz College faculty. He placed great emphasis on educating people so that they would be \"well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, concerned about improving and enhancing the world, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all\", a mission that shaped and was subsequently adopted by his son. Elsie was a teacher and activist born in Belarus. They met at Mikveh Israel, where they both worked.\\n\\nNoam was the Chomskys\\' first child. His younger brother, David Eli Chomsky, was born five years later, in 1934. The brothers were close, though David was more easygoing while Noam could be very competitive. Chomsky and his brother were raised Jewish, being taught Hebrew and regularly discussing the political theories of Zionism; the family was particularly influenced by the Left Zionist writings of Ahad Ha\\'am. Chomsky faced antisemitism as a child, particularly from Philadelphia\\'s Irish and German communities.\\n\\nChomsky attended the independent, Deweyite Oak Lane Country Day School and Philadelphia\\'s Central High School, where he excelled academically and joined various clubs and societies, but was troubled by the school\\'s hierarchical and regimented teaching methods. He also attended Hebrew High School at Gratz College, where his father taught.\\n\\nChomsky has described his parents as \"normal Roosevelt Democrats\" with center-left politics, but other relatives involved in the International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union exposed him to socialism and far-left politics. He was substantially influenced by his uncle and the Jewish leftists who frequented his New York City newspaper stand to debate current affairs. Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores when visiting his uncle in the city, voraciously reading political literature. He wrote his first article at age 10 on the spread of fascism following the fall of Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and, from the age of 12 or 13, identified with anarchist politics. He later described his discovery of anarchism as \"a lucky accident\" that made him critical of Stalinism and other forms of Marxism–Leninism.\\n\\nUniversity: 1945–55\\n\\nIn 1945, aged 16, Chomsky began a general program of study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning Arabic. Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew. Frustrated with his experiences at the university, he considered dropping out and moving to a kibbutz in Mandatory Palestine, but his intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist Zellig Harris, whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject. Chomsky\\'s BA honors thesis, \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", applied Harris\\'s methods to the language. Chomsky revised this thesis for his MA, which he received from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951; it was subsequently published as a book. He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of Nelson Goodman.\\n\\nFrom 1951 to 1955 Chomsky was a member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, where he undertook research on what became his doctoral dissertation. Having been encouraged by Goodman to apply, Chomsky was attracted to Harvard in part because the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine was based there. Both Quine and a visiting philosopher, J. L. Austin of the University of Oxford, strongly influenced Chomsky. In 1952 Chomsky published his first academic article, Systems of Syntactic Analysis, which appeared not in a journal of linguistics but in The Journal of Symbolic Logic. Highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures at the University of Chicago and Yale University. He had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, but in 1955 he submitted a thesis setting out his ideas on transformational grammar; he was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree for it, and it was privately distributed among specialists on microfilm before being published in 1975 as part of The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory. Harvard professor George Armitage Miller was impressed by Chomsky\\'s thesis and collaborated with him on several technical papers in mathematical linguistics. Chomsky\\'s doctorate exempted him from compulsory military service, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.\\n\\nIn 1947 Chomsky began a romantic relationship with Carol Doris Schatz, whom he had known since early childhood. They married in 1949. After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to the Allston area of Boston and remained there until 1965, when they relocated to the suburb of Lexington. In 1953 the couple took a Harvard travel grant to Europe, from the United Kingdom through France, Switzerland into Italy, and Israel, where they lived in Hashomer Hatzair\\'s HaZore\\'a kibbutz. Despite enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the country\\'s Jewish nationalism, anti-Arab racism and, within the kibbutz\\'s leftist community, pro-Stalinism.\\n\\nOn visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of the Yiddish anarchist journal Fraye Arbeter Shtime and became enamored with the ideas of Rudolf Rocker, a contributor whose work introduced Chomsky to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism. Chomsky also read other political thinkers: the anarchists Mikhail Bakunin and Diego Abad de Santillán, democratic socialists George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, and Dwight Macdonald, and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht, Karl Korsch, and Rosa Luxemburg. His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the Spanish Civil War, as documented in Orwell\\'s Homage to Catalonia (1938). He read the leftist journal Politics, which furthered his interest in anarchism, and the council communist periodical Living Marxism, though he rejected the orthodoxy of its editor, Paul Mattick. He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the Leninist League of the United States, an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their view that the Second World War was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union\\'s \"state capitalists\" to crush Europe\\'s proletariat.\\n\\nEarly career: 1955–66\\nChomsky befriended two linguists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Morris Halle and Roman Jakobson, the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position there in 1955. At MIT, Chomsky spent half his time on a mechanical translation project and half teaching a course on linguistics and philosophy. He described MIT as \"a pretty free and open place, open to experimentation and without rigid requirements. It was just perfect for someone of my idiosyncratic interests and work.\" In 1957 MIT promoted him to the position of associate professor, and from 1957 to 1958 he was also employed by Columbia University as a visiting professor. The Chomskys had their first child that same year, a daughter named Aviva. He also published his first book on linguistics, Syntactic Structures, a work that radically opposed the dominant Harris–Bloomfield trend in the field. Responses to Chomsky\\'s ideas ranged from indifference to hostility, and his work proved divisive and caused \"significant upheaval\" in the discipline. The linguist John Lyons later asserted that Syntactic Structures \"revolutionized the scientific study of language\". From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.\\n\\nIn 1959 Chomsky published a review of B. F. Skinner\\'s 1957 book Verbal Behavior in the academic journal Language, in which he argued against Skinner\\'s view of language as learned behavior. The review argued that Skinner ignored the role of human creativity in linguistics and helped to establish Chomsky as an intellectual. With Halle, Chomsky proceeded to found MIT\\'s graduate program in linguistics. In 1961 he was awarded tenure, becoming a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics. Chomsky went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth International Congress of Linguists, held in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which established him as the de facto spokesperson of American linguistics. Between 1963 and 1965 he consulted on a military-sponsored project \"to establish natural language as an operational language for command and control\"; Barbara Partee, a collaborator on this project and then-student of Chomsky, has said this research was justified to the military on the basis that \"in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program.\"\\n\\nChomsky continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar (1966), and Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966). Along with Halle, he also edited the Studies in Language series of books for Harper and Row. As he began to accrue significant academic recognition and honors for his work, Chomsky lectured at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966. His Beckman lectures at Berkeley were assembled and published as Language and Mind in 1968. Despite his growing stature, an intellectual falling-out between Chomsky and some of his early colleagues and doctoral students—including Paul Postal, John \"Haj\" Ross, George Lakoff, and James D. McCawley—triggered a series of academic debates that came to be known as the \"Linguistics Wars\", although they revolved largely around philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.\\n\\nAntiwar activism and dissent: 1967–75\\n\\nChomsky joined protests against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1962, speaking on the subject at small gatherings in churches and homes. His 1967 critique of U.S. involvement, \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\", among other contributions to The New York Review of Books, debuted Chomsky as a public dissident. This essay and other political articles were collected and published in 1969 as part of Chomsky\\'s first political book, American Power and the New Mandarins. He followed this with further political books, including At War with Asia (1971), The Backroom Boys (1973), For Reasons of State (1973), and Peace in the Middle East? (1975), published by Pantheon Books. These publications led to Chomsky\\'s association with the American New Left movement, though he thought little of prominent New Left intellectuals Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm and preferred the company of activists to that of intellectuals. Chomsky remained largely ignored by the mainstream press throughout this period.\\n\\nHe also became involved in left-wing activism. Chomsky refused to pay half his taxes, publicly supported students who refused the draft, and was arrested while participating an antiwar teach-in outside the Pentagon. During this time, Chomsky co-founded the antiwar collective RESIST with Mitchell Goodman, Denise Levertov, William Sloane Coffin, and Dwight Macdonald. Although he questioned the objectives of the 1968 student protests, Chomsky gave many lectures to student activist groups and, with his colleague Louis Kampf, ran undergraduate courses on politics at MIT independently of the conservative-dominated political science department. When student activists campaigned to stop weapons and counterinsurgency research at MIT, Chomsky was sympathetic but felt that the research should remain under MIT\\'s oversight and limited to systems of deterrence and defense. In 1970 he visited southeast Asia to lecture at Vietnam\\'s Hanoi University of Science and Technology and toured war refugee camps in Laos. In 1973 he helped lead a committee commemorating the 50th anniversary of the War Resisters League.\\n\\nBecause of his antiwar activism, Chomsky was arrested on multiple occasions and included on President Richard Nixon\\'s master list of political opponents. Chomsky was aware of the potential repercussions of his civil disobedience and his wife began studying for her own doctorate in linguistics to support the family in the event of Chomsky\\'s imprisonment or joblessness. Chomsky\\'s scientific reputation insulated him from administrative action based on his beliefs.\\n\\nHis work in linguistics continued to gain international recognition as he received multiple honorary doctorates. He delivered public lectures at the University of Cambridge, Columbia University (Woodbridge Lectures), and Stanford University. His appearance in a 1971 debate with French continental philosopher Michel Foucault positioned Chomsky as a symbolic figurehead of analytic philosophy. He continued to publish extensively on linguistics, producing Studies on Semantics in Generative Grammar (1972), an enlarged edition of Language and Mind (1972), and Reflections on Language (1975). In 1974 Chomsky became a corresponding fellow of the British Academy.\\n\\nEdward S. Herman and the Faurisson affair: 1976–80\\n\\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s, Chomsky\\'s linguistic publications expanded and clarified his earlier work, addressing his critics and updating his grammatical theory. His political talks often generated considerable controversy, particularly when he criticized the Israeli government and military. In the early 1970s Chomsky began collaborating with Edward S. Herman, who had also published critiques of the U.S. war in Vietnam. Together they wrote Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact & Propaganda, a book that criticized U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and the mainstream media\\'s failure to cover it. Warner Modular published it in 1973, but its parent company disapproved of the book\\'s contents and ordered all copies destroyed.\\n\\nWhile mainstream publishing options proved elusive, Chomsky found support from Michael Albert\\'s South End Press, an activist-oriented publishing company. In 1979, South End published Chomsky and Herman\\'s revised Counter-Revolutionary Violence as the two-volume The Political Economy of Human Rights, which compares U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. It argues that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on events in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy. Chomsky\\'s response included two testimonials before the United Nations\\' Special Committee on Decolonization, successful encouragement for American media to cover the occupation, and meetings with refugees in Lisbon. The Marxist academic Steven Lukes publicly accused Chomsky of betraying his anarchist ideals and acting as an apologist for Cambodian leader Pol Pot. The controversy damaged Chomsky\\'s reputation, and he maintains that his critics deliberately printed lies to defame him.\\n\\nChomsky had long publicly criticized Nazism, and totalitarianism more generally, but his commitment to freedom of speech led him to defend the right of French historian Robert Faurisson to advocate a position widely characterized as Holocaust denial. Without Chomsky\\'s knowledge, his plea for Faurisson\\'s freedom of speech was published as the preface to the latter\\'s 1980 book . Chomsky was widely condemned for defending Faurisson, and France\\'s mainstream press accused Chomsky of being a Holocaust denier himself, refusing to publish his rebuttals to their accusations. Critiquing Chomsky\\'s position, sociologist Werner Cohn later published an analysis of the affair titled Partners in Hate: Noam Chomsky and the Holocaust Deniers. The Faurisson affair had a lasting, damaging effect on Chomsky\\'s career, especially in France.\\n\\nCritique of propaganda and international affairs: 1980–2001\\n\\nIn 1985, during the Nicaraguan Contra War—in which the U.S. supported the contra militia against the Sandinista government—Chomsky traveled to Managua to meet with workers\\' organizations and refugees of the conflict, giving public lectures on politics and linguistics. Many of these lectures were published in 1987 as On Power and Ideology: The Managua Lectures. In 1983 he published The Fateful Triangle, which argued that the U.S. had continually used the Israeli–Palestinian conflict for its own ends. In 1988, Chomsky visited the Palestinian territories to witness the impact of Israeli occupation.\\n\\nIn 1988, Chomsky and Herman published Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, in which they outlined their propaganda model for understanding mainstream media. They argued that even in countries without official censorship, the news is censored through five filters that have great impact on what stories are reported and how they are presented. The book was inspired by Alex Carey and adapted into a 1992 film. In 1989, Chomsky published Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies, in which he suggests that democratic citizens, to make a worthwhile democracy, undertake intellectual self-defense against the media and elite intellectual culture that seeks to control them. By the 1980s, Chomsky\\'s students had become prominent linguists who, in turn, expanded and revised his linguistic theories.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, Chomsky embraced political activism to a greater degree than before. Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia to talk on the issue at the behest of the East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance. The lectures he gave on the subject were published as Powers and Prospects in 1996. As a result of the international publicity Chomsky generated, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger. After East Timor attained independence from Indonesia in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor\\'s oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.\\n\\nIraq war criticism and retirement from MIT: 2001–2017\\n\\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, Chomsky was widely interviewed; Seven Stories Press collated and published these interviews that October. Chomsky argued that the ensuing War on Terror was not a new development but a continuation of U.S. foreign policy and concomitant rhetoric since at least the Reagan era. He gave the D.T. Lakdawala Memorial Lecture in New Delhi in 2001, and in 2003 visited Cuba at the invitation of the Latin American Association of Social Scientists. Chomsky\\'s 2003 Hegemony or Survival articulated what he called the United States\\' \"imperial grand strategy\" and critiqued the Iraq War and other aspects of the War on Terror. Chomsky toured internationally with greater regularity during this period.\\n\\nChomsky retired from MIT in 2002, but continued to conduct research and seminars on campus as an emeritus. That same year he visited Turkey to attend the trial of a publisher who had been accused of treason for printing one of Chomsky\\'s books; Chomsky insisted on being a co-defendant and amid international media attention the Security Courts dropped the charge on the first day. During that trip Chomsky visited Kurdish areas of Turkey and spoke out in favor of the Kurds\\' human rights. A supporter of the World Social Forum, he attended its conferences in Brazil in both 2002 and 2003, also attending the Forum event in India.\\n\\nChomsky supported the Occupy movement, delivering talks at encampments and producing two works that chronicled its influence: Occupy (2012), a pamphlet, and Occupy: Reflections on Class War, Rebellion and Solidarity (2013). He attributed Occupy\\'s growth to a perception that the Democratic Party had abandoned the interests of the white working class. In March 2014, Chomsky joined the advisory council of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, an organization that advocates the global abolition of nuclear weapons, as a senior fellow. The 2016 documentary Requiem for the American Dream summarizes his views on capitalism and economic inequality through a \"75-minute teach-in\".\\n\\nUniversity of Arizona: 2017–present\\nIn 2017, Chomsky taught a short-term politics course at the University of Arizona in Tucson and was later hired as a part-time professor in the linguistics department there, with his duties including teaching and public seminars. His salary is covered by philanthropic donations.\\n\\nChomsky signed the Declaration on the Common Language of the Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins in 2018.\\n\\nLinguistic theory\\n\\nThe basis of Chomsky\\'s linguistic theory lies in biolinguistics, the linguistic school that holds that the principles underpinning the structure of language are biologically preset in the human mind and hence genetically inherited. As such he argues that all humans share the same underlying linguistic structure, irrespective of sociocultural differences. In adopting this position Chomsky rejects the radical behaviorist psychology of B.\\xa0F. Skinner, who viewed behavior (including talking and thinking) as a completely learned product of the interactions between organisms and their environments. Accordingly, Chomsky argues that language is a unique evolutionary development of the human species and distinguished from modes of communication used by any other animal species. Chomsky\\'s nativist, internalist view of language is consistent with the philosophical school of \"rationalism\" and contrasts with the anti-nativist, externalist view of language consistent with the philosophical school of \"empiricism\", which contends that all knowledge, including language, comes from external stimuli.\\n\\nUniversal grammar\\n\\nSince the 1960s Chomsky has maintained that syntactic knowledge is at least partially inborn, implying that children need only learn certain language-specific features of their native languages. He bases his argument on observations about human language acquisition and describes a \"poverty of the stimulus\": an enormous gap between the linguistic stimuli to which children are exposed and the rich linguistic competence they attain. For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and finite subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered, in that language. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of inductive reasoning, if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks the language acquisition device, and suggested that one of linguists\\' tasks should be to determine what that device is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that result from these constraints would constitute \"universal grammar\". Multiple scholars have challenged universal grammar on the grounds of the evolutionary infeasibility of its genetic basis for language, the lack of universal characteristics between languages, and the unproven link between innate/universal structures and the structures of specific languages.\\n\\nTransformational-generative grammar\\n\\nTransformational-generative grammar is a broad theory used to model, encode, and deduce a native speaker\\'s linguistic capabilities. These models, or \"formal grammars\", show the abstract structures of a specific language as they may relate to structures in other languages. Chomsky developed transformational grammar in the mid-1950s, whereupon it became the dominant syntactic theory in linguistics for two decades. \"Transformations\" refers to syntactic relationships within language, e.g., being able to infer that the subject between two sentences is the same person. Chomsky\\'s theory posits that language consists of both deep structures and surface structures: Outward-facing surface structures relate phonetic rules into sound, while inward-facing deep structures relate words and conceptual meaning. Transformational-generative grammar uses mathematical notation to express the rules that govern the connection between meaning and sound (deep and surface structures, respectively). By this theory, linguistic principles can mathematically generate potential sentences structures in a language. Scholar Michael Tomasello has challenged Chomsky\\'s theory as based in logic and not empiricism.\\n\\nBased on this rule-based notation of grammars,  Chomsky grouped natural languages into a series of four nested subsets and increasingly complex types, together known as the Chomsky hierarchy. This classification was and remains foundational to formal language theory, and relevant to theoretical computer science, especially programming language theory, compiler construction, and automata theory.\\n\\nFollowing transformational grammar\\'s heyday through the mid-1970s, a derivative government and binding theory became a dominant research framework through the early 1990s (and remains an influential theory) when linguists turned to a \"minimalist\" approach to grammar. This research focused on the principles and parameters framework, which explained children\\'s ability to learn any language by filling open parameters (a set of universal grammar principles) that adapt as the child encounters linguistic data. The minimalist program, initiated by Chomsky, asks which minimal principles and parameters theory fits most elegantly, naturally, and simply. In an attempt to simplify language into a system that relates meaning and sound using the minimum possible faculties, Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as \"deep structure\" and \"surface structure\" and instead emphasizes the plasticity of the brain\\'s neural circuits, with which come an infinite number of concepts, or \"logical forms\". When exposed to linguistic data, a hearer-speaker\\'s brain proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way language works. Thus while much of Chomsky\\'s prior research focused on the rules of language, he now focuses on the mechanisms the brain uses to generate these rules and regulate speech.\\n\\nPolitical views\\n\\nChomsky is a prominent political dissident. His political views have changed little since his childhood, when he was influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition. He usually identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist. He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet human needs: liberty, community, and freedom of association. Unlike some other socialists, such as Marxists, Chomsky believes that politics lies outside the remit of science, but he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.\\n\\nIn Chomsky\\'s view, the truth about political realities is systematically distorted or suppressed by an elite corporatocracy, which uses corporate media, advertising, and think tanks to promote its own propaganda. His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth they obscure. Chomsky believes this web of falsehood can be broken by \"common sense\", critical thinking, and understanding the roles of self-interest and self-deception, and that intellectuals abdicate their moral responsibility to tell the truth about the world in fear of losing prestige and funding. He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his social privilege, resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements in their struggles.\\n\\nAlthough he has joined protest marches and organized activist groups, Chomsky\\'s primary political outlets are education and publication. He offers a wide range of political writings as well as free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness. He is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World international union.\\n\\nUnited States foreign policy \\n\\nChomsky has been a prominent critic of American imperialism; he believes that the basic principle of the foreign policy of the United States is the establishment of \"open societies\" that are economically and politically controlled by the United States and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper. He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant with U.S. interests and to ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power. When discussing current events, he emphasizes their place within a wider historical perspective. He believes that official, sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British extraterritorial operations have consistently whitewashed these nations\\' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances, spreading Christianity; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them. Prominent examples he regularly cites are the actions of the British Empire in India and Africa and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.\\n\\nChomsky\\'s political work has centered heavily on criticizing the actions of the United States. He has said he focuses on the U.S. because the country has militarily and economically dominated the world during his lifetime and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows the citizenry to influence government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the impact U.S. foreign policies have on the populations affected by them, he can sway the populations of the U.S. and other countries into opposing the policies. He urges people to criticize their governments\\' motivations, decisions, and actions, to accept responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as to themselves.\\n\\nChomsky has been critical of U.S. involvement in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement. Chomsky also criticizes the U.S.\\'s close ties with Saudi Arabia and involvement in Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, highlighting that Saudi Arabia has \"one of the most grotesque human rights records in the world\".\\n\\nCapitalism and socialism\\nIn his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of capitalism and the pursuit of material wealth. At the same time, he developed a disdain for authoritarian socialism, as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union. Rather than accepting the common view among U.S. economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy and total private ownership, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy and total autocratic control (whether state or private). He argues that Western capitalist countries are not really democratic, because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy. He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.\\n\\nChomsky highlights that, since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescinding of the Bretton Woods financial control agreement. He characterizes the U.S. as a de facto one-party state, viewing both the Republican Party and Democratic Party as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests. Chomsky highlights that, within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.\\n\\nNoting the entrenchment of such an economic system, Chomsky believes that change is possible through the organized cooperation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to reorganize the economy more equitably. Acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifles any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism in historical examples such as the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women\\'s rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population\\'s welfare has worsened as a result of upheaval.\\n\\nChomsky sees libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas as the descendants of the classical liberal ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being\". He envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future with direct worker control of the means of production and government by workers\\' councils, who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies. The point of this self-governance is to make each citizen, in Thomas Jefferson\\'s words, \"a direct participator in the government of affairs.\" He believes that there will be no need for political parties. By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment and purpose. He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.\\n\\nIsraeli–Palestinian conflict \\n\\nChomsky has written prolifically on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, aiming to raise public awareness of it. He has long endorsed a left binationalist program in Israel and Palestine, seeking to create a democratic state in the Levant that is home to both Jews and Arabs. Nevertheless, given the realpolitik of the situation, he has also considered a two-state solution on the condition that the nation-states exist on equal terms. Chomsky was denied entry to the West Bank in 2010 because of his criticisms of Israel. He had been invited to deliver a lecture at Bir Zeit University and was to meet with Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman later said that Chomsky was denied entry by mistake.\\n\\nNews media and propaganda \\n\\nChomsky\\'s political writings have largely focused on ideology, social and political power, the media, and state policy. One of his best-known works, Manufacturing Consent, dissects the media\\'s role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies across the political spectrum while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky asserts that this version of censorship, by government-guided \"free market\" forces, is subtler and harder to undermine than was the equivalent propaganda system in the Soviet Union. As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate-owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests. Acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the mass media\\'s choices of topics and issues, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state\\'s ideology: although mass media will criticize individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part. As evidence, he highlights that the U.S. mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators. He also points to examples of important news stories that the U.S. mainstream media has ignored because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the country, including the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton with possible FBI involvement, the massacres in Nicaragua perpetrated by U.S.-funded Contras, and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths without equivalent coverage of the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in that conflict. To remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.\\n\\nChomsky considers most conspiracy theories fruitless, distracting substitutes for thinking about policy formation in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives. While not dismissing them outright, he considers them unproductive to challenging power in a substantial way. In response to the labeling of his own ideas as a conspiracy theory, Chomsky has said that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether General Motors would be accused of conspiracy if it deliberately selected what it used or discarded to sell its product.\\n\\nOther disciplines \\nChomsky has also been active in a number of philosophical fields, including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science. In these fields he is credited with ushering in the \"cognitive revolution\", a significant paradigm shift that rejected logical positivism, the prevailing philosophical methodology of the time, and reframed how philosophers think about language and the mind. Chomsky views the cognitive revolution as rooted in 17th-century rationalist ideals. His position—the idea that the mind contains inherent structures to understand language, perception, and thought—has more in common with rationalism (Enlightenment and Cartesian) than behaviorism. He named one of his key works Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought (1966). In philosophy of language, Chomsky is particularly known for his criticisms of the notion of reference and meaning in human language and his perspective on the nature and function of mental representations.\\n\\nChomsky\\'s famous 1971 debate on human nature with the French philosopher Michel Foucault was symbolic in positioning Chomsky as the prototypical analytic philosopher against Foucault, a stalwart of the continental tradition. It showed what appeared to be irreconcilable differences between two moral and intellectual luminaries of the 20th century. Foucault\\'s position was that of critique, that human nature could not be conceived in terms foreign to present understanding, while Chomsky held that human nature contained universalities such as a common standard of moral justice as deduced through reason based on what rationally serves human necessity. Chomsky criticized postmodernism and French philosophy generally, arguing that the obscure language of postmodern, leftist philosophers gives little aid to the working classes. He has also debated analytic philosophers, including Tyler Burge, Donald Davidson, Michael Dummett, Saul Kripke, Thomas Nagel, Hilary Putnam, Willard Van Orman Quine, and John Searle.\\n\\nChomsky\\'s contributions span intellectual and world history, including history of philosophy. Irony is a recurring characteristic of his writing, as he often implies that his readers know better, which can make them more engaged in the veracity of his claims.\\n\\nPersonal life\\n\\nChomsky endeavors to keep his family life, linguistic scholarship, and political activism strictly separate from one another, calling himself \"scrupulous at keeping my politics out of the classroom\". An intensely private person, he is uninterested in appearances and the fame his work has brought him. He also has little interest in modern art and music. McGilvray suggests that Chomsky was never motivated by a desire for fame, but impelled to tell what he perceived as the truth and a desire to aid others in doing so. Chomsky acknowledges that his income affords him a privileged life compared to the majority of the world\\'s population; nevertheless, he characterizes himself as a \"worker\", albeit one who uses his intellect as his employable skill. He reads four or five newspapers daily; in the US, he subscribes to The Boston Globe, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Christian Science Monitor. Chomsky is non-religious, but has expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology.\\n\\nChomsky has attracted controversy for calling established political and academic figures \"corrupt\", \"fascist\", and \"fraudulent\". His colleague Steven Pinker has said that he \"portrays people who disagree with him as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric\", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions he receives from critics. Chomsky avoids attending academic conferences, including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences. His approach to academic freedom has led him to support MIT academics whose actions he deplores; in 1969, when Chomsky heard that Walt Rostow, a major architect of the Vietnam war, wanted to return to work at MIT, Chomsky threatened \"to protest publicly\" if Rostow was denied a position at MIT. In 1989, when Pentagon adviser John Deutch applied to be president of MIT, Chomsky supported his candidacy. Later, when Deutch became head of the CIA, The New York Times quoted Chomsky as saying, \"He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I\\'ve ever met. ... If somebody\\'s got to be running the CIA, I\\'m glad it\\'s him.\"\\n\\nChomsky was married to Carol () from 1949 until her death in 2008. They had three children together: Aviva (b. 1957), Diane (b. 1960), and Harry (b. 1967). In 2014, Chomsky married Valeria Wasserman.\\n\\nReception and influence\\n\\nChomsky has been a defining Western intellectual figure, central to the field of linguistics and definitive in cognitive science, computer science, philosophy, and psychology. In addition to being known as one of the most important intellectuals of his time, Chomsky carries a dual legacy as both a \"leader in the field\" of linguistics and \"a figure of enlightenment and inspiration\" for political dissenters. Despite his academic success, his political viewpoints and activism have resulted in his being distrusted by the mainstream media apparatus, and he is regarded as being \"on the outer margin of acceptability\". The reception of his work is intertwined with his public image as an anarchist, a gadfly, an historian, a Jew, a linguist, and a philosopher.\\n\\nIn academia\\nMcGilvray observes that Chomsky inaugurated the \"cognitive revolution\" in linguistics, and that he is largely responsible for establishing the field as a formal, natural science, moving it away from the procedural form of structural linguistics dominant during the mid-20th century. As such, some have called Chomsky \"the father of modern linguistics\". Linguist John Lyons further remarked that within a few decades of publication, Chomskyan linguistics had become \"the most dynamic and influential\" school of thought in the field. By the 1970s his work had also come to exert a considerable influence on philosophy, and a Minnesota State University Moorhead poll ranked Syntactic Structures as the single most important work in cognitive science. In addition, his work in automata theory and the Chomsky hierarchy have become well known in computer science, and he is much cited in computational linguistics.\\n\\nChomsky\\'s criticisms of behaviorism contributed substantially to the decline of behaviorist psychology; in addition, he is generally regarded as one of the primary founders of the field of cognitive science. Some arguments in evolutionary psychology are derived from his research results; Nim Chimpsky, a chimpanzee who was the subject of a study in animal language acquisition at Columbia University, was named after Chomsky in reference to his view of language acquisition as a uniquely human ability.\\n\\nACM Turing Award winner Donald Knuth credited Chomsky\\'s work with helping him combine his interests in mathematics, linguistics, and computer science. IBM computer scientist John Backus, another Turing Award winner, used some of Chomsky\\'s concepts to help him develop FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level computer programming language. The laureates of the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine — Georges J. F. Köhler, César Milstein, and Niels Kaj Jerne — used Chomsky\\'s generative model to explain the human immune system, equating \"components of a generative grammar ... with various features of protein structures.\" Chomsky\\'s theory of generative grammar has also influenced work in music theory and analysis.\\n\\nAn MIT press release stated that Chomsky was cited within the Arts and Humanities Citation Index more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992. Chomsky was also extensively cited in the Social Sciences Citation Index and Science Citation Index during the same time period, with the librarian who conducted the research commenting that the statistics show that \"he is very widely read across disciplines and that his work is used by researchers across disciplines ... it seems that you can\\'t write a paper without citing Noam Chomsky.\" As a result of his influence, there are dueling camps of Chomskyan and non-Chomskyan linguistics, with the disputes between the two camps often acrimonious.\\n\\nIn politics\\nChomsky\\'s status as the \"most-quoted living author\" is credited to his political writings, which vastly outnumber his writings on linguistics. Chomsky biographer Wolfgang B. Sperlich characterizes him as \"one of the most notable contemporary champions of the people\"; journalist John Pilger has described him as a \"genuine people\\'s hero; an inspiration for struggles all over the world for that basic decency known as freedom. To a lot of people in the margins—activists and movements—he\\'s unfailingly supportive.\" Arundhati Roy has called him \"one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time\", and Edward Said thought him \"one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions\". Fred Halliday has said that by the start of the 21st century Chomsky had become a \"guru\" for the world\\'s anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements. The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media, also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media, including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.\\n\\nSperlich also notes that Chomsky has been vilified by corporate interests, particularly in the mainstream press. University departments devoted to history and political science rarely include Chomsky\\'s work on their undergraduate syllabi. Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no formal expertise in these areas; he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them regardless of whether they have been academically trained to do so. According to McGilvray, many of Chomsky\\'s critics \"do not bother quoting his work or quote out of context, distort, and create straw men that cannot be supported by Chomsky\\'s text\".\\n\\nChomsky drew criticism for not calling the Srebrenica massacre during the Bosnian War a \"genocide\", which he said would devalue the word, and in appearing to deny Ed Vulliamy\\'s reporting on the existence of Bosnian concentration camps. The subsequent editorial correction of his comments, viewed as a capitulation, was criticized by multiple Balkan watchers.\\n\\nChomsky\\'s far-reaching criticisms of U.S. foreign policy and the legitimacy of U.S. power have raised controversy. A document obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from the U.S. government revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) monitored his activities and for years denied doing so. The CIA also destroyed its files on Chomsky at some point, possibly in violation of federal law. He has often received undercover police protection at MIT and when speaking on the Middle East, but has refused uniformed police protection. German newspaper Der Spiegel described Chomsky as \"the Ayatollah of anti-American hatred\", while conservative commentator David Horowitz called him \"the most devious, the most dishonest and\\xa0... the most treacherous intellect in America\", whose work is infused with \"anti-American dementia\" and evidences his \"pathological hatred of his own country\". Writing in Commentary magazine, the journalist Jonathan Kay described Chomsky as \"a hard-boiled anti-American monomaniac who simply refuses to believe anything that any American leader says\".\\n\\nChomsky\\'s criticism of Israel has led to his being called a traitor to the Jewish people and an anti-Semite. Criticizing Chomsky\\'s defense of the right of individuals to engage in Holocaust denial on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, Werner Cohn called Chomsky \"the most important patron\" of the neo-Nazi movement. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which has been accused of monitoring Chomsky\\'s activities, called him a Holocaust denier, describing him as a \"dupe of intellectual pride so overweening that he is incapable of making distinctions between totalitarian and democratic societies, between oppressors and victims\". In turn, Chomsky has claimed that the ADL is dominated by \"Stalinist types\" who oppose democracy in Israel. The lawyer Alan Dershowitz has called Chomsky a \"false prophet of the left\"; Chomsky called Dershowitz \"a complete liar\" who is on \"a crazed jihad, dedicating much of his life to trying to destroy my reputation\". In early 2016 President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey publicly rebuked Chomsky after he signed an open letter condemning Erdoğan for his anti-Kurdish repression and double standards on terrorism. Chomsky accused Erdoğan of hypocrisy, noting that Erdoğan supports al-Qaeda\\'s Syrian affiliate, the al-Nusra Front.\\n\\nIn February 2020, before attending the 2020 Hay Festival in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Chomsky, along with a number of other bestselling authors like Stephen Fry and Jung Chang signed a letter of condemnation against the violation of freedom of speech in the emirate hosting one of the biggest literature & arts festival, referring to the arrest of human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor.\\n\\nAcademic achievements, awards, and honors\\n\\nIn 1970, the London Times named Chomsky one of the \"makers of the twentieth century\". He was voted the world\\'s leading public intellectual in The 2005 Global Intellectuals Poll jointly conducted by American magazine Foreign Policy and British magazine Prospect. New Statesman readers listed Chomsky among the world\\'s foremost heroes in 2006.\\n\\nIn the United States he is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Philosophical Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Abroad he is a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, an honorary member of the British Psychological Society, a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, and a foreign member of the Department of Social Sciences of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. He received a 1971 Guggenheim Fellowship, the 1984 American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology, the 1988 Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences, the 1996 Helmholtz Medal, the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science, the 2010 Erich Fromm Prize, and the British Academy\\'s 2014 Neil and Saras Smith Medal for Linguistics. He is also a two-time winner of the NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language (1987 and 1989). He has also received the Rabindranath Tagore Centenary Award from The Asiatic Society.\\n\\nChomsky received the 2004 Carl-von-Ossietzky Prize from the city of Oldenburg, Germany, to acknowledge his body of work as a political analyst and media critic. He received an honorary fellowship in 2005 from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin. He received the 2008 President\\'s Medal from the Literary and Debating Society of the National University of Ireland, Galway. Since 2009, he has been an honorary member of International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI). He received the University of Wisconsin\\'s A.E. Havens Center\\'s Award for Lifetime Contribution to Critical Scholarship and was inducted into IEEE Intelligent Systems\\' AI\\'s Hall of Fame for \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems.\" Chomsky has an Erdős number of four.\\n\\nIn 2011, the US Peace Memorial Foundation awarded Chomsky the US Peace Prize for antiwar activities over five decades. For his work in human rights, peace, and social criticism, he received the 2011 Sydney Peace Prize, the 2017 Seán MacBride Peace Prize and the Dorothy Eldridge Peacemaker Award.\\n\\nChomsky has received honorary doctorates from institutions including the University of London and the University of Chicago (1967), Loyola University Chicago and Swarthmore College (1970), Bard College (1971), Delhi University (1972), and the University of Massachusetts (1973) among others. His public lectures have included the 1969 John Locke Lectures, 1975 Whidden Lectures, 1977 Huizinga Lecture, and 1988 Massey Lectures, among others.\\n\\nVarious tributes to Chomsky have been dedicated over the years. He is the eponym for a bee species, a frog species, and a building complex at the Indian university Jamia Millia Islamia. Actor Viggo Mortensen and avant-garde guitarist Buckethead dedicated their 2003 album Pandemoniumfromamerica to Chomsky.\\n\\nSelected bibliography \\n\\nLinguistics\\n Syntactic Structures (1957)\\n Current Issues in Linguistic Theory (1964)\\n Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965)\\n Cartesian Linguistics (1965)\\n Language and Mind (1968)\\n The Sound Pattern of English with Morris Halle (1968)\\n Reflections on Language (1975)\\n Lectures on Government and Binding (1981)\\n The Minimalist Program (1995)\\n\\nPolitics\\n American Power and the New Mandarins (1969)\\n Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact & Propaganda with Edward S.

       "{'title': 'Joseph Greenberg',\n",
       " 'text': 'Joseph Harold Greenberg (May 28, 1915 – May 7, 2001) was an American linguist, known mainly for his work concerning linguistic typology and the genetic classification of languages.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nEarly life and education \\n\\nJoseph Greenberg was born on May 28, 1915 to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. His first great interest was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert in Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano frequently throughout his life.\\n\\nAfter finishing high school, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at Columbia University in New York. During his senior year, he attended a class taught by Franz Boas concerning American Indian languages. With references from Boas and Ruth Benedict, he was accepted as a graduate student by Melville J. Herskovits at Northwestern University in Chicago. During the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the Hausa people of Nigeria, where he learned the Hausa language. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of Islam on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.\\n\\nDuring 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at Yale University. These were interrupted by service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, for which he worked as a codebreaker and participated with the landing at Casablanca. Before leaving for Europe during 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia University.\\n\\nCareer\\nAfter the war, Greenberg taught at the University of Minnesota before returning to Columbia University during 1948 as a teacher of anthropology. While in New York, he became acquainted with Roman Jakobson and André Martinet. They introduced him to the Prague school of structuralism, which influenced his work.\\n\\nDuring 1962, Greenberg relocated to the anthropology department of Stanford University in California, where he continued to work for the rest of his life. During 1965 Greenberg served as president of the African Studies Association. He received during 1996 the highest award for a scholar in Linguistics, the Gold Medal of Philology.\\n\\nContributions to linguistics\\n\\nLinguistic typology \\n\\nGreenberg\\'s reputation rests partly on his contributions to synchronic linguistics and the quest to identify linguistic universals. During the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.\\n\\nIn particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of \"implicational universal\", which has the form, \"if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y.\" For example, X might be \"mid front rounded vowels\" and Y \"high front rounded vowels\" (for terminology see phonetics). Many scholars adopted this kind of research following Greenberg\\'s example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.\\n\\nLike Noam Chomsky, Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures on which human language is based. Unlike Chomsky, Greenberg\\'s method was functionalist, rather than formalist. An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan methods can be found in Linguistic Universals (2006), edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil .\\n\\nMany who are strongly opposed to Greenberg\\'s methods of language classification (see below) acknowledge the importance of his typological work. During 1963 he published an article that was extremely influential: \"Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements\".\\n\\nMass comparison \\n\\nGreenberg rejected the opinion, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that comparative reconstruction was the only method to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: one cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until one knows which languages to compare (1957:44).\\n\\nHe also criticized the prevalent opinion that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time (which commonly take years to perform) could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,749,027,089,305,918,018 ways (1957:44). For comparison, the Niger–Congo family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate such means.\\n\\nGreenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared (to basic vocabulary, morphology, and known paths of sound change) and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases strongly with the number of languages concerned (1957:39).\\n\\nGreenberg used the premise that mass \"borrowing\" of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters \"in certain semantic areas\", making it easy to detect (1957:39). With the goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the idea was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those phenomena caused difficulties for his theory.\\n\\nGreenberg first termed his method \"mass comparison\" in an article of 1954 (reprinted in Greenberg 1955). As of 1987, he replaced the term \"mass comparison\" with \"multilateral comparison\", to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended by linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step (Greenberg, 1957:44). According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification (Greenberg, 1957:45).\\n\\nMost historical linguists (Campbell 2001:45) reject the use of mass comparison as a method for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been Lyle Campbell, Donald Ringe, William Poser, and the late R. Larry Trask.\\n\\nGenetic classification of languages\\n\\nLanguages of Africa \\n\\nGreenberg is known widely for his development of a classification system for the languages of Africa, which he published as a series of articles in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology from 1949 to 1954 (reprinted together as a book, The Languages of Africa, in 1955). He revised the book and published it again during 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition of 1966 (reprinted without change during 1970). A few more changes of the classification were made by Greenberg in an article during 1981.\\n\\nGreenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed Afroasiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger–Congo, and Khoisan. During the course of his work, Greenberg invented the term \"Afroasiatic\" to replace the earlier term \"Hamito-Semitic\", after showing that the Hamitic group, accepted widely since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to establish the classification of the Bantu languages, which occupy much of sub-Saharan Africa, as a part of the Niger–Congo family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan language family. Now, apart from Khoisan, it is generally accepted by African specialists and has been used as a basis for further work by other scholars.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s work on African languages has been criticised by Lyle Campbell and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data and request a re-examination of his macro-phyla by \"reliable methods\" (Ringe 1993:104). Harold Fleming and Lionel Bender, who were sympathetic to Greenberg\\'s classification, acknowledged that at least some of his macrofamilies (particularly the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoisan macrofamiles) are not accepted completely by most linguists and may need to be divided (Campbell 1997). Their objection was methodological: if mass comparison is not a valid method, it cannot be expected to have brought order successfully out of the confusion of African languages.\\n\\nBy contrast, some linguists have sought to combine Greenberg\\'s four African families into larger units. In particular, Edgar Gregersen (1972) proposed joining Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan into a larger family, which he termed Kongo-Saharan. Roger Blench (1995) suggests Niger–Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.\\n\\nThe languages of New Guinea, Tasmania, and the Andaman Islands\\n\\nDuring 1971 Greenberg proposed the Indo-Pacific macrofamily, which groups together the Papuan languages (a large number of language families of New Guinea and nearby islands) with the native languages of the Andaman Islands and Tasmania but excludes the Australian Aboriginal languages. Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the Austronesian languages, which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of people.\\n\\nGreenberg\\'s subgrouping of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of Stephen Wurm (1982) and Malcolm Ross (2005) has provided considerable evidence for his once-radical idea that these languages form a single genetic unit. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and Timor–Alor families \"are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances.\" He believes this to be due to a linguistic substratum.\\n\\nThe languages of the Americas\\n\\nMost linguists concerned with the native languages of the Americas classify them into 150 to 180 independent language families. Some believe that two language families, Eskimo–Aleut and Na-Dené, were distinct, perhaps the results of later migrations into the New World.\\n\\nEarly on, Greenberg (1957:41, 1960) became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book Language in the Americas, while agreeing that the Eskimo–Aleut and Na-Dené groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed Amerind.\\n\\nLanguage in the Americas has generated lively debate, but has been criticized strongly; it is rejected by most specialists of indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists of the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenberg\\'s data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.\\n\\nHistorical linguists also reject the validity of the method of multilateral (or mass) comparison upon which the classification is based. They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of errors, accidental similarity, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.\\n\\nHowever, Harvard geneticist David Reich notes that recent genetic studies have identified patterns that support Greenberg\\'s Amerind classification: the “First American” category. “The cluster of populations that he predicted to be most closely related based on language were in fact verified by the genetic patterns in populations for which data are available.” Nevertheless, this category of “First American” people also interbred with and contributed a significant amount of genes to the ancestors of both Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dené populations, with 60% and 90% \"First American\" DNA respectively constituting the genetic makeup of the two groups.\\n\\nThe languages of northern Eurasia \\n\\nLater in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern Eurasia belong to a single higher-order family, which he termed Eurasiatic. The only exception was Yeniseian, which has been related to a wider Dené–Caucasian grouping, also including Sino-Tibetan.  During 2008 Edward Vajda related Yeniseian to the Na-Dené languages of North America as a Dené–Yeniseian family.\\n\\nThe Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older Nostratic groupings of Holger Pedersen and Vladislav Illich-Svitych by including Indo-European, Uralic, and Altaic. It differs by including Nivkh, Japonic, Korean, and Ainu (which the Nostraticists had excluded from comparison because they are single languages rather than language families) and in excluding Afroasiatic. At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably Sergei Starostin, constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly larger than Greenberg\\'s grouping but it also excluded Afroasiatic.\\n\\nRecently, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern \\'tier\\' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern \\'tier\\' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).\\n\\nThe American Nostraticist Allan Bomhard considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic, alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, Elamo-Dravidian, and Kartvelian. Similarly, Georgiy Starostin (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to any other language family. Sergei Starostin\\'s school has now included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic. They reserve the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping, which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise inclusion of Dravidian and Kartvelian.\\n\\nGreenberg continued to work on this project after he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer and until he died during May 2001. His colleague and former student Merritt Ruhlen ensured the publication of the final volume of his Eurasiatic work (2002) after his death.\\n\\nSelected works by Joseph H.
